# Gene-Regulatory-network
Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) represent the complex interactions among genes that govern cellular processes and development. Accurate reconstruction of GRNs is critical for understanding biological systems, disease mechanisms, and for advancing personalized medicine. Time series gene expression data, which captures dynamic gene behavior over time
